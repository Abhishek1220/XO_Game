It is a fully Customized "Tic-Tac-Toe" game and is user-defined. Users can choose to play against the computer or with a friend. It is coded in Java using OOP's concept.
Key Features:
User Interface: The game features a simple yet interactive console-based user interface, making it accessible and easy to understand for players of all skill levels.
Game Logic: The core of the project lies in the implementation of the game's logic. Players take turns entering their moves, and the program checks for winning conditions after each move. This involves handling various scenarios such as horizontal, vertical, and diagonal alignments.
Input Validation: Robust input validation ensures that players can only make valid moves within the confines of the game grid. This prevents unexpected errors and enhances the overall user experience.

Restart and Exit Options: After a game concludes, players have the option to restart and play again or exit the program. This adds user-friendly functionality to enhance the overall experience.
Code Structure: The Java Tic-Tac-Toe Game is well-structured, featuring modular code that promotes readability and ease of maintenance. It adheres to best practices in Java programming, making it a great learning resource for those looking to understand code organization and style.
Overall, this mini-project serves as an excellent introduction to Java programming, offering hands-on experience in building a functional and entertaining application. The combination of user interface design, game logic implementation, and code organization makes it a valuable learning tool for Java enthusiasts at various skill levels.
